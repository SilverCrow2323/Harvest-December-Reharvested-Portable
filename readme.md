Project introduction

Welcome to Harvest December: Reharvested: Portable!

This is a RenPy port of the 3DS (and iOS and PC) VN "Harvest December", to the Nintendo Switch and PS Vita. It uses Autumn Rivers' code! (they run Harvest December: Reharvested, a PC port of Harvest December, which is of course what this project is based off of!)

Ths VN is in the process of being ported! Vita first and hopefully Switch afterwards!

A big thank you to @SilverCrow2323 for being a huge help with the port! Without his help this project wouldn't have been able to get running off the ground!

I appreciate your continued interest in this project!
